## Treatment: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS/EMT)

### What is TMS?

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (EMT in Spanish) is an advanced medical therapy and neuroscience-based treatment that uses magnetic pulses to non-invasively stimulate specific areas of the brain related to different emotional and cognitive functions.

### Treatment Details

- **Session Duration:** 20-40 minutes
- **Patient State:** Awake and relaxed, seated in a comfortable chair
- **Equipment:** May include a special helmet for greater mobility (ideal for children or people who feel more comfortable moving)
- **Process:** Before starting, an initial clinical interview and evaluation is conducted to determine if the person is a candidate for treatment

### How TMS Works

TMS acts by precisely stimulating brain zones linked to each diagnosis or symptom, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit. The protocols used are approved by COFEPRIS and the FDA, supported by more than two decades of scientific research. This stimulation helps improve brain connectivity, regulate neurotransmitters, and restore normal brain activity, promoting overall improvement in mental and emotional functioning.
